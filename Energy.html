<h1>Sources of Energy</h1>
<p>The largest source of energy on land is sunlight. There are different purposes for which energy is needed such as for food, for lightning, transport, running machines etc.</p>

<p>A good source of energy should be-</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheap and easily available.

<li>Safe in handling and use.

<li>Do not cause any environment pollution.

<li>Easy to store and transport.</li></ul>
<h2>Fuels</h2>
<p>Materials that are burnt and used to store energy are defined as fuels. For Example, Wood, Coal etc.<p>

Features of Good Fuel-
<ul>
<li>It should have high calorific value.

<li>It should not produce smoke while burning.

<li>Cheap and easily available.

<li>Easy to handle and safe to transport.

<li>Convenient in storage.</li></ul>

<h2>Sources of Energy</h2>
There are two types of Sources of Energy - Conventional Sources of Energy and Non-conventional Sources of Energy. Conventional sources of energy include the fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum. Non-conventional sources include solar cooker, solar cell panel etc.

<h2>Conventional Sources of Energy</h2>
<h3>Fossil Fuels</h3>
<ul>
<li>These fuels are developed from fossils.

<li>They are present in limited amount.

<li>They are non-renewable sources of energy.

<li>These fuels cause pollution. They release different oxides which causes acid rain which damages plants, animals, houses etc. Excessive release of carbon-dioxide also causes global warming.

<li>Pollution by the fossil fuels can be controlled by increasing the efficiency of combustion process and using other techniques to escape the harmful gases.
</ul>

<h3>Thermal Power Plants</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thermal power plants use steam produced by burning fossil fuels (mainly coal) to move the turbines to generate electricity.
<li>The burning of coal heats up the water and forms steam that is used to run the turbine.
<li>Usually, Thermal power plants are located near coal or oil fields as it is easier to transmit electricity than transport coal.
</li></ul>

<h3>Biomass</h3>

<p>The dead remains of plants and animals is known as Biomass. 
</p><p>
Wood: It produces biomass and can be used as fuel for a long time. It produces smoke during burning. It does not produce much heat.
<p>
Charcoal: When wood is burnt in limited supply of oxygen, it produces charcoal. Charcoal is a better fuel than wood as it has high calorific value. It does not produce smoke while burning.
<p>
Cow Dung: It produces lots of smoke. It does not completely burn. It has low calorific value. It also produces ash.
<p>
Bio Gas: Biogas plant produces biogas. It is an excellent fuel. It leaves no residue. Has a very high heat capacity. Biogas plant is used to treat farm wastes or energy crops. Biogas plant consists of large tank or digester. In this bacteria convert organic waste into methane gas using energy.</p><br>

<h3>Hydro Power Plants</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use to convert potential energy of falling water into electricity. They are associated with dams. They do not cause any pollution. Dam construction also prevents flooding of rivers and also provide water for irrigation.</li>

<li>But there are certain disadvantages associated with hydro power plants. Large areas are needed for hydro power plants. Human settlement is affected as well as ecosystem is destroyed.</li></ul>

<h3>Wind Energy</h3> <ul style="line-height: 35px">
<li>Environment-friendly efficient source of energy.
<li>Wind is the natural phenomenon caused by pressure differentials due to unequal heating of land and water masses on the surface of the earth. It is harnessed in the form of kinetic energy.

<li>Wind Energy is harnessed by rotatory structures known as windmills.
They have huge blades or fans attached very high on a rigid support that is attached to turbines that rotate due to high speeds of wind and generate electricity.
<li>A single windmill has a low output and therefore, the wind farms are built that comprises of several windmills.</li>
<LI>Advantages: Environment-friendly, efficient, renewable source, with no recurring cost for production of electricity.</LI>

<li>Limitations:
<ul type="circle" >
<li>Wind speeds should be constant and > 15 km/h.</li>
<li>Must have back up storage facilities like cells.</li>
<li>Requires large land area. ​
​​​​​​<li>High initial cost and regular maintenance are required.</li></li></ul></ul>

<br><br>
<h2>Non-conventional Sources of Energy</h2>
<h3>Solar Energy</h3><ul>
<li>Solar energy is the ultimate source of energy. There are different solar energy devices such as Solar Cooker, Solar Water heaters, Solar cells etc.</li>

<li>Energy from the sea comes from surface waves and tidal power is obtained from kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Ocean water provide large amount of renewable energy.
</li>
<li>Solar cooker use minimal fuel consumption and is a device that uses direct sunlight to cook or heat the drinks, food materials etc.
</li>
<li>Solar cell is an electrical device that converts light energy into electricity. It is based on physical and chemical formula.
</li></ul>

<H3>Geothermal Energy</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>There is a huge amount of heat trapped inside the earth. Molten rocks from Earth’s core sometimes come up due to geological changes and get trapped in hotspots. Harnessing this heat energy is called geothermal energy.</LI>
<LI>Any underground water present gets heated due to the hotspots and gets converted to steam which escapes from the surface of the earth as hot springs.</LI>
<li>This steam is used to rotate turbines and generate electricity.</li></UL>

<br><br><br>
<h3>Nuclear Energy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Nuclear energy can be used to generate electricity by means of nuclear fission.</li>
<li>In a nuclear reactor, the nuclear fuel is used to carry out sustained fission chain reaction to produce electricity at a controlled rate.</li></ul>

<h2>Environmental Consequences</h2>
<p>No source of energy is pollution free. They cause little or more pollution. Though solar cells do not produce any pollution, but its set up can cause environmental damage.</p>
