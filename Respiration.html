<h1><center>Respiration</center></h1>

<p><b>Respiration: </b>The process by which a living being utilises the food to get energy, is called respiration.
Respiration is an oxidation reaction in which carbohydrate is oxidized to produce energy.</p>
<p style="border: 2px solid #ff9900; background: #fff7e6; padding: 8px">Mitochondria is the site of respiration and the energy released is stored in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).
 ATP is stored in mitochondria and is released as per need.</p>
 
 <h2>Types of Respiration</h2>
 <ol><li><b>Aerobic Respiration:</b>This type of respiration happens in the <u>presence of oxygen</u>.
 Pyruvic acid is converted into carbon dioxide.
 Energy is released and water molecule is also formed at the end of this process.<br>
 
 </li><br>
 
 <li><b>Anaerobic Respiration: </b>This type of respiration happens in the<u> absence  of oxygen</u>. 
 Pyruvic acid is either converted into ethyl alcohol or lactic acid. 
 <ul type="disc">
 <li>Ethyl alcohol is usually formed in case of anaerobic respiration in microbes, like yeast or bacteria.</li>
 <li>Lactic acid is formed in some microbes as well as in the muscle cells.</li></ul></li></ol>

 <h2>Mechanism of Respiration</h2>
 <h3>Respiration occurs in two stages-</h3>
  <ol>
 <li><b>The first stage-</b> is known as glycolysis and produces pyruvic acid from glucose.</li><br>
 <li><b>The second stage- </b> is called Krebs cycle in which pyruvic acid is further broken down.
  The degradation of food material up to pyruvic acid formation is same in both aerobic and anaerobic respiration,
  while the further degradation of pyruvic acid differs in the two types of respiration as given in the table.
</li></ol>

<h2>Human Respiratory System</h2>
<p>The human respiratory system is composed of a pair of lungs. These are attached to a system of tubes which open on the outside through the nostrils.<br>
Following are the main structures in the human respiratory system:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Nostrils:</b> There are two nostrils which converge to form a nasal passage. The inner lining of the nostrils is lined by hair and remains wet due to mucus secretion.
 The mucus and the hair help in filtering the dust particles out from inhaled air. Further, air is warmed up when it enters the nasal passage.</li><br>
<li><b>Pharynx:</b> It is a tube-like structure which continues after the nasal passage.</li><br>
<li><b>Larynx:</b> This part comes after the pharynx. This is also called voice box.</li><br>
<li><b>Trachea:</b> This is composed of rings of cartilage. Cartilaginous rings prevent the collapse of trachea in the absence of air.</li><br>
<li><b>Bronchi: </b>A pair of bronchi comes out from the trachea, with one bronchus going to each lung.</li><br>
<li><b>Bronchioles:</b> A bronchus divides into branches and sub-branches inside the lung.</li><br>
<li><b>Alveoli:</b> These are air sacs at the end of bronchioles. The alveolus is composed of a very thin membrane and is the place where blood capillaries open.
 This is alveolus, where the oxygen mixes with the blood and carbon dioxide exits from the blood. 
 The exchange of gases, in alveoli, takes place due to the pressure differential.</li>

 <h2>Physiology of Respiration</h2>
 <ul>
<li>Breathing in humans is facilitated by the action of internal intercostal and external intercostal muscles attached to the ribs and the diaphragm.</li>
<li>When the dome-shaped diaphragm contracts and becomes flattened and the rib cage is expanded due to the action of intercostal muscles, the volume of the lungs increases, pressure there drops down and the air from outside gushes in. This is inhalation.</li>
<li>To exhale, the diaphragm relaxes, becomes dome-shaped again, chest cavity contracts due to the action of intercostal muscles, the volume inside the lungs decreases, pressure increases and the air is forced out of the lungs.
<li>Inhaled air increases the concentration of oxygen in the alveoli,  so oxygen simply diffuses into the surrounding blood vessels.
<li>Blood coming from cells has more concentration of carbon dioxide than outside air and thus carbon dioxide simply diffuses out of the blood vessels into the alveoli.
<li>Thus, breathing takes place due to the combined action of intercostal muscles and diaphragm while the exchange of gases takes place due to simple diffusion.</li></ul>

<h2>Inhalation and Exhalation</h2>
<p>The process of taking in air rich in oxygen is called inhalation.<br>
Similarly, the process of giving out air rich in carbon dioxide is called exhalation.<br>
One breath comprises one inhalation and one exhalation.<br>
A person breathes several times in a day.<br>
The number of times a person breathes in one minute is termed as his/her breathing rate.</p>

<h2>Why Do We Need Lungs</h2><ul>
<li>In unicellular organisms like an amoeba exchange of gases takes place through a general body surface by osmosis.
<li>In lower animals like an earthworm, the gaseous exchange takes place through their moist skin.
<li>The requirement of oxygen is sufficiently met by these ways.
<li>But as the animal starts becoming more and more complex, for example, human, the requirement of oxygen cannot be met alone by diffusion.
<li>Moreover, diffusion will not be able to supply oxygen to the deep-seated cells.
<li>This difficulty has led to the evolution of a more complex mechanism of gaseous exchange and that is the development of lungs.
<li>The alveoli present in the lungs provide a large surface area required for the necessary gas exchange.</ul>

<h2>Respiration in Plants</h2><ul>
<li>Unlike animals and humans, plants do not have any specialized structures for gaseous exchange<br>
<li>They have stomata (present in leaves) and lenticels (present in stems) which are involved in the exchange of gases.<br>
<li>Compared to animals, plant roots, stems, and leaves respire at a very lower rate.<br></ul>
