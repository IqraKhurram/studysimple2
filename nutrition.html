<CENTER><h1>NUTRITION</h1></CENTER>


<P><B>Nutrition:</B> The process by which an organism takes food and utilizes it, is called nutrition.</P>

<P><B>Need for Nutrition:</B> Organisms need the energy to perform various activities. The energy is supplied by the nutrients. Organisms need various raw materials for growth and repair. These raw materials are provided by nutrients.</P>
<P><B>Nutrients:</B> Materials which provide nutrition to organisms are called nutrients. Carbohydrates, proteins and fats are the main nutrients and are called macronutrients. Minerals and vitamins are required in small amounts and hence are called micronutrients.</P>
<P><B>Modes of Nutrition</B>
	<ol>
<li>Autotrophic Nutrition.</li>
<li>Heterotrophic Nutrition.</li></ol></P>

<H2>Autotrophic Nutrition</H2>
<p>The mode of nutrition in which an organism prepares its own food is called autotrophic nutrition. Green plants and blue-green algae follow the autotrophic mode of nutrition.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The organisms which carry out autotrophic nutrition are called autotrophs (green plants).</li>
<li>Autotrophic nutrition is fulfilled by the process, by which autotrophs intake CO2 and H2O, and convert these into carbohydrates in the presence of chlorophyll, sunlight is called photosynthesis.
<img href=""></li></ul>

<h2>Heterotrophic Nutrition</h2>
In this mode of nutrition, an organism is unable to synthesize its own food. It is of following types-
<ol>
<li><b> Holozoic nutrition</b> is a type of nutrition where an organism takes in whole food and break it inside the body. For example, Amoeba.</li>

<li><b>Saprophytic nutrition</b> is a nutrition in which organisms feed on dead and decaying matter. For example, fungi.</li>

<li><b>Parasitic nutrition</b> is a nutrition in which organism feed on living host. For example, Cuscutta. </li></ol>

<h2>Nutrition in Plants</h2>
<h3>What is Photosynthesis?</h3>
<p>For the photosynthesis to occur, carbon-dioxide, water, sunlight and chlorophyll are the required raw materials. Sunlight provides energy, chlorophyll is used to absorb the sunlight, carbon-dioxide is reduced to carbohydrates and water is oxidized to release the oxygen. Water is taken up from the soil through the roots.</p>

<p>The site where the photosynthesis occurs in known as chloroplast. They contain green colour pigment known as chlorophyll that traps sunlight for photosynthesis.</p>

<h3><b>Events during Photosynthesis</b></h3>
<ol type="I">
	<LI><b><u>Light Reaction:</u></b>
		<ol type="i">
    <li>Absorption of light energy by chlorophyll</li>
    <li>Conversion of light energy to chemical energy and splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.</li></li></ol><br>
    <li><b><u>Dark Reaction:</u></b>
    	<ol type="i" start="3">
    		<li>Reduction of carbon-dioxide into carbohydrates.</li></ol></li></ol>


<P class="stomata">
Leaves contain small openings known as stomata which helps in exchange of gases. Stomata/stoma is surrounded by guard cell which guards the opening and closing of stomata.

<h2>Nutrition in Animals</h2>
<h3>Steps in Nutrition</h3>
<ol>
	<li><b>Ingestion:</b> The process of taking in the food is called ingestion.</li>
<li><b>Digestion:</b> The process of breaking complex food substances into simple molecules is called digestion. Simple molecules, thus obtained, can be absorbed by the body.</li>
<li><b>Absorption:</b> The process of absorption of digested food is called absorption.</li>
<li><b>Assimilation: </b>The process of utilization of digested food, for energy and for growth and repair is called assimilation.</li>
<li><b>Egestion:</b> The process of removing undigested food from the body is called egestion.</li>
</ol>

<H2>Digestive System in Humans</H2>
<p>Digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and the organs associated with anus. It is a muscular coiled tubular structure about nine metres in length.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Alimentary Canal: <ol type="i">
		<li>Mouth
		<LI> Oesophagus
			<LI>Stomach
		<LI>Small intestine <LI>Large intestine.</LI></OL><br>
<LI>Associated Glands:  Main associated glands are 
	<OL TYPE="i">

<li>Salivary gland</li>
<li>Gastric Glands</li>
<li>Liver</li>
<li>Pancreas</li></OL></ol></ul>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b6/c0/52/b6c052cd6e8c203788924bd5ee64f7e1.png" width="400px">

<h3>Mouth or Buccal Cavity</h3><ul>
<li>The mouth has teeth and tongue. Salivary glands are also present in the mouth.
<li>The tongue has gustatory receptors which perceive the sense of taste.
<li>The tongue helps in turning over the food so that saliva can be properly mixed in it.
<li>Teeth help in breaking down the food into smaller particles so that, swallowing of food becomes easier.
<li>There are four types of teeth in human beings. The incisor teeth are used for cutting the food.
<li>The canine teeth are used for tearing the food and for cracking hard substances.
<li>The premolars are used for the coarse grinding of food. The molars are used for fine grinding of food.</ul>


<h3>Salivary glands secrete saliva:</h3><p> Saliva makes the food slippery which makes it easy to swallow the food. Saliva also contains the enzyme salivary amylase or ptyalin. Salivary amylase digests starch and converts it into sucrose, (maltose).</p>

<h3>Oesophagus</h3><li> Taking food from mouth to stomach by Peristaltic movement.


 
<li><b>Peristaltic movement:</b> Rhythmic contraction of muscles of the lining of the alimentary canal to push the food forward.</li><br>

<h3>Stomach</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stomach is a bag-like organ. Highly muscular walls of the stomach help in churning the food.
<li>The walls of the stomach secrete hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid kills the germs which may be present in food.
<li>Moreover, it makes the medium inside the stomach as acidic. The acidic medium is necessary for gastric enzymes to work.
<li>The enzyme pepsin, secreted in the stomach, does partial digestion of protein.
<li>The mucus, secreted by the walls of the stomach saves the inner lining of the stomach from getting damaged from hydrochloric acid.</ul>

<h3>Liver</h3> <p>Liver is the largest organ in the human body. The liver manufactures bile, which gets stored in the gall bladder. From the gall bladder, bile is released as and when required.</p>

<h3>Pancreas</h3> <p>Pancreas is situated below the stomach. It secretes pancreatic juice which contains many digestive enzymes.</p>
<img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Life-Processes-6.png" width="500px">
<h3>Small Intestine</h3><ul>
<li>The small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary canal, about 20 feet long in humans.
<li>It has regions, duodenum, the region which follows stomach, jejunum is the middle part and ileum is the later region which continues further into the large intestine.
<li>The internal surface of the small intestine is folded into finger-like projections called villi.
<li>A common pancreatic duct from pancreas and liver opens into the duodenum.
Most of the chemical digestion and absorption takes place in the small intestine.</ul>

<h3>Large Intestine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Large intestine is smaller than the small intestine.
<li>Undigested food goes into the large intestine.
<li>Some water and salt are absorbed by the walls of the large intestine. After that, the undigested food goes to the rectum, from where it is expelled out through the anus.
<li>Large Intestine bbsorb excess of water. The rest of the material is removed from the body via the anus. (Egestion).</ul>
