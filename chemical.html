<h1>Chemical Reactions and Equations</h1>
<h2>Chemical Reactions</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Chemical reactions</b> are chemical changes in which reactants transform into products by making or breaking of bonds (or both) between different atoms.</li>
<li>A chemical reaction can be determined with the help of any of the following observations:<br>
a) Evolution of a gas<br>
b) Change in temperature<br>
c) Formation of a precipitate<br>
d) Change in colour<br>
e) Change of state<br></li></ul>

<h2>Chemical Equation</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Chemical Equation:</b> Representation of chemical reaction using symbols and formulae of the substances is called Chemical Equation.<br>
Example: A + B → C + D</li>
<li>In this equation, A and B are called reactants and C and D are called the products. The arrow shows the direction of the chemical reaction. Condition, if any, is written generally above the arrow.</li>


<li><b>Reactant:</b> Substances which take part in a chemical reaction are called reactants.<br>
Example: Mg and O2.</li>

<li><b>Product:</b> New substance formed after a chemical reaction is called a product.<br>
Example: MgO.</li></ul>
<h2>Balanced Chemical Equation</h2><ul>
 <li><b> Balanced Chemical Equation: </b>A balanced chemical equation has the number of atoms of each element equal on both sides.</li>
<li>Example: Zn + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → ZnSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub><br>

In this equation, numbers of zinc, hydrogen and sulphate are equal on both sides, so it is a Balanced Chemical Equation.
According to the <b>Law of Conservation of Mass</b>, mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. To obey this law, the total mass of elements present in reactants must be equal to the total mass of elements present in products.</li></ul>
<h2>Types of Chemical Reactions:</h2>
<p>Chemical reactions can be classified in following types:</p>
<p><strong>(i) Combination Reaction:</strong> Reactions in which two or more reactants combine to form one product are called Combination Reactions.<br>
A general combination reaction can be represented by the chemical equation given here:<br>
A + B → AB<br>
Examples:<br>
When magnesium is burnt in the air (oxygen), magnesium oxide is formed. In this reaction, magnesium is combined with oxygen.<br>
Mg(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2MgO(s)<br>
Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium Oxide</p>
<p><strong>(ii) Decomposition Reaction:</strong> Reactions in which one compound decomposes in two or more compounds or elements are known as Decomposition Reaction. A decomposition reaction is just the opposite of combination reaction.<br>
A general decomposition reaction can be represented as follows :<br>
AB → A + B<br>
Examples:<br>
When calcium carbonate is heated, it decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.<br>
CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s)  –(heat)→ CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)<br>
Calcium carbonate → Calcium oxide + Carbon dioxide</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Thermal Decomposition:</strong> The decomposition of a substance on heating is known as Thermal Decomposition.<br>
Example: 2Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(s)  –(heat)→ 2PbO(s) + 4NO<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)

</li>

<li><strong>Electrolytic Decomposition:</strong> Reactions in which compounds decompose into simpler compounds because of passing of electricity, are known as Electrolytic Decomposition. This is also known as Electrolysis.<br>
Example: When electricity is passed in water, it decomposes into hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) –(electrolysis)→ 2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)</li>

<li><strong>Photolysis or Photo Decomposition Reaction:</strong> Reactions in which a compound decomposes because of sunlight are known as Photolysis or Photo Decomposition Reaction.<br>
Example: When silver chloride is put in sunlight, it decomposes into silver metal and chlorine gas.<br>
2AgCl(s) (white) –(Sunlight)→ 2Ag(s) (grey) + Cl<sub>2</sub>(g)<br></li>
<img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chemical-Reactions-and-Equations-3.png" width="600px"><br><br></ol>

<p><strong>(iii) Displacement Reaction:</strong> The chemical reactions in which a more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from a compound is known as Displacement Reactions. Displacement reactions are also known as Substitution Reaction or Single Displacement/ replacement reactions.<br>
A general displacement reaction can be represented by using a chemical equation as follows :<br>
A + BC → AC + B<br>
Displacement reaction takes place only when ‘A’ is more reactive than B. If ‘B’ is more reactive than ‘A’, then ‘A’ will not displace ‘C’ from ‘BC’ and reaction will not be taking place.<br>
Examples:<br>
When zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid, it gives hydrogen gas and zinc chloride.<br>
Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)</p><br>

<p><strong>(iv) Double Displacement Reaction:</strong> Reactions in which ions are exchanged between two reactants forming new compounds are called Double Displacement Reactions.<br>
AB + CD → AC + BD<br>
Examples:<br>
When the solution of barium chloride reacts with the solution of sodium sulphate, white precipitate of barium sulphate is formed along with sodium chloride.<br>
BaCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) → BaSO<sub>4</sub>(s) (Precipitate) + 2NaCl(aq)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Precipitation reaction</b>
An insoluble compound called precipitate forms when two solutions containing soluble salts are combined.<br>
Pb(NO<SUB>3</SUB>)<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2KL(aq) → 2KNO<SUB>3</SUB>(aq) + PbCl<sub>2</sub>(s)(yellow)
</li></ul>

<br><br><br>
<p><b>(v) Redox reaction</b>
Oxidation and reduction take place simultaneously.<ul>
<li><b>Oxidation:</b> Substance loses electrons or gains oxygen or loses hydrogen.
<li><b>Reduction:</b> Substance gains electrons or loses oxygen or gains hydrogen.
<li><b>Oxidising agent</b> – a substance that oxidises another substance and self-gets reduced.
<li><b>Reducing agent</b> – a substance that reduces another substance and self-gets oxidised.</ul></li>
<p>Example<br>
When copper oxide is heated with hydrogen, then copper metal and hydrogen are formed.<br>
CuO + H<sub>2</sub> → Cu + H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
In this reaction, CuO is changing into Cu. Oxygen is being removed from copper oxide. Removal of oxygen from a substance is called Reduction, so copper oxide is being reduced to copper.</p></li><br>


<li><b>Exothermic Reaction</b>
  <p>Exothermic reaction – heat is evolved during a reaction. Most of the combination reactions are exothermic.<br>


    Al + Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3&nbsp;</sub>→ Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3&nbsp;</sub>+ Fe + heat<br>
CH<sub>4&nbsp;</sub>+ 2O<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>→ CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O + heat</p></li>

<li><b>Endothermic Reaction</b>
  <p>Endothermic – Heat is required to carry out the reaction<br>
  6CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>+ 6H<sub>2</sub>O + Sunlight → C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6&nbsp;</sub>+ 6O<sub>2</sub></p></ul><br>

<h2>Corrosion</h2>
<p>Gradual deterioration of a material, usually a metal, by the action of moisture, air or chemicals in the surrounding environment.<br>

Rusting:<br>
<p><sub>&nbsp;</sub>4Fe(s) + 3O<sub>2</sub>(from&nbsp;air) +&nbsp;<em>x</em>H<sub>2</sub>O(moisture) → 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.<em>x</em>H<sub>2</sub>O(rust)<br>
Corrosion of copper:<br>
Cu(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O(moisture) + CO<sub>2</sub>(from&nbsp;air) → CuCO<sub>3</sub>.Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>(green)<br>
Corrosion of silver:<br>
Ag(s) + H<sub>2</sub>S (from&nbsp;air) → Ag<sub>2</sub>S(black) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)</p>

<h2>Rancidity</h2>
<p>It refers to the oxidation of fats and oils in food that is kept for a long time. It gives foul smell and bad taste to food. Rancid food causes stomach infection on consumption.<br>
Prevention:<br>
(i) Use of air-tight containers<br>
(ii) Packaging with nitrogen<br>
(iii) Refrigeration<br>
(iv) Addition of antioxidants or preservatives<br></p>
